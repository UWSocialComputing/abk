# Low Fidelity Prototype Design


We have two parts to our prototype – chat instructions to simulate how users could interact with each other socially about their sleep, and a figma to see how users interact with the potential UI for our app.

For the Figma, we have 4 different screens: a Dashboard, Feed, Chat, and Rating. The main screens are the Dashboard (to store your progress, set goals, and set your phone to track your sleep progress), the Feed (to see what others are sharing about their sleep/progress/goals and rate your own sleep), and Chats for accountability. The wizardry behind the figma is that the UI and its transitions are preset and you can’t do much besides press the buttons that we’ve enabled. So you can navigate to the different pages and click Wake Up on the dash to then rate your sleep and continue navigating. This part is the wizardry because we can show the basic way the app would be used without having a full implementation – it demonstrates how we want users to interact with the app in a simple way.

For the chat, we have a basic script and set of instructions to share with users interested in helping us with our prototyping. They will need a group chat with at least one other person and they will share their goals (ie setting a bedtime/waking up time, identifying problem areas, and choosing how they like to be held accountable), motivate each other, and share their progress over the course of around 3 days. Our wizardry for this is that we are relying on different apps or messaging services for people to interact with each other and share information about their sleep. This is because having our script and instructions to influence the behavior of a group chat can help us see how responsive users are to share and be vulnerable about their sleep information without the commitment that a full chat from a sleep app would require. We would later implement a chat within our app that would be the proper environment for that.

### Instructions for the Wizard of Oz Prototyping


First  message: 
Hello! I am working on a social computing capstone with my group snooze you lose. We are creating an application to help promote a consistent healthy sleep routine. Would you be willing to take part in our prototyping research? We would like for you to either find another friend or create a group with a few friends to keep each other accountable for three days. 


Second message:
We are so glad you will take part in our prototyping! Please try your best to be honest with the people in your group. Even if you don’t wake up or go to sleep at the time you planned, still share with your group the time you truly woke up. We will provide you with a few instructions to help you with this experience. Please let us know if you have any questions!  


Instructions: 
* We would like for you to create a group chat with your friend(s). It can be on any social media platform or text group that works best for you!
* Have each person share their goals for their ideal healthy sleep routine. 
The goals consist of: 
   * Set bedtime 
   * Set wake up
   * Share your problem areas. Example: I struggle with waking up in the morning. I tend to snooze. 
   * Choose an accountability type that you prefer. This can consist of:
      * Friend calling you
      * Messaging you
      * Posting on social media
      * Shaming you
      * Owing your friend money
      * Or any other form of accountability that you think of
* Share your progress. For example: when you wake up and when you go to sleep. This can be in the form of a message, a picture, or any other way you would like to communicate your progress. 
* Try encouraging messages on the feed when people post their updates. Whether that is reacting to the post, sharing your progress, sending gifs, etc.
